# 📊 Market Campaign Project

This project performs an in-depth analysis of a marketing dataset to uncover insights into customer behavior, segment the customer base, and support data-driven marketing strategies.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains various customer attributes such as:
- Demographics (Age, Education, Marital Status)
- Financial data (Income)
- Purchase history across different product categories
- Campaign response behavior

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Understand customer profiles and purchase behavior.
- Identify trends in marketing campaign responses.
- Segment customers for targeted marketing strategies.
- Visualize key metrics and insights using plots and charts.

## 🧪 Key Steps

1. **Data Inspection**:
   - Loaded the dataset using Pandas
   - Inspected null values, datatypes, and overall structure

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed or imputed null values
   - Converted monetary and categorical fields

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Plotted income distribution, age groups, and campaign responses
   - Explored relationships between features and response rates

4. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Created meaningful customer segments based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) or clustering techniques

## 📈 Visualizations

Key plots include:
- Age distribution histogram
- Income vs Spending scatter plot
- Campaign response bar chart
- Heatmaps for correlation
